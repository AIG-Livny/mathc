# MathC

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ferreiradaselva/mathc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ferreiradaselva/mathc)

MathC is a simple math library for 2D and 3D programming. It contains implementations for:

- 2D vectors
- 3D vectors
- Quaternions
- Matrices
- Easing functions

It support C99 standard or later.

# Float

Every structure and function uses `float`, because it is the most used type on 2D and 3D programming with OpenGL.

# Vector Structure

All vectors (2D, 3D and quaternions ) use the same structure type `cvector`.

Examples:

```c
/* Rotate a 2D vector 90ยบ */
cvector direction = to_vector2(0.0f, -1.0f);
direction = vector2_rotate(90.0f * M_PIF / 180.0f);

/* Get the angle (radians) of a 2D vector */
float angle = vector2_angle(direction);

/* Create a 3D vector */
cvector position = to_vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

/* Create a quaternion */
cvector quaternion = to_quaternion(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
/* Spherical interpolation between two quaternions */
cvector interpolated = quaternion_spherical_linear_interpolation(a, b, 0.5f);
```

# Passing Arguments as Value or Pointer

For every function **that takes a structure**, there are two versions. One that you pass structures as value and other that you pass as pointer. The functions that pass the value by pointer have a prefix `p` and the result is the `*result` argument or a returned `float`.

You can decide which one you want to use.

Examples:

```c
/* Pass by value and return a value */
cmatrix projection = matrix_ortho(-100.0f, 100.0f, -100.0f, 100.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
cmatrix view = matrix_look_at(to_vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f),
	to_vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f),
	to_vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));
cmatrix pv = matrix_multiply_matrix(projection, view);

/* Pass by pointer */
cmatrix projection;
cmatrix view;
cvector pos;
cvector target;
cvector up;
cmatrix multiplied_matrix;

pmatrix_ortho(-100.0f, 100.0f, -100.0f, 100.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, &projection);
pmatrix_look_at(&pos, &target, &up, &view);
pmatrix_multiply_matrix(&projection, &view, &multiplied_matrix);
```

# Matrices

Matrices are 4ร4.

# Easing Functions

The easing functions are an implementation of the functions presented in [easing.net](http://easings.net/). They are mainly useful for animations.

Easing functions take a value that range from `0.0f` to `1.0f` and usually will return a value inside that same range. However, in some of the easing functions, the returned value extrapolate that range.

- If you find any error, you can open an issue.
- You can request more useful functions in the issues regarding 2D vectors, 3D vectors, quaternions and matrices. If you have already an implementation or know where to find, better.
