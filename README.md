# C Math

CMath is a simple math library for 2D and 3D programming. It contains implementations for:

- 2D vectors
- 3D vectors
- 4D vectors
- Quaternions
- Matrices
- Easing functions

# Float

Every structure and function uses `float`, because it is the most used type on 2D and 3D programming with OpenGL.

# 4D vectors and Quaternions

Their structures are the same, however they have different functions.

# Matrices

Matrices are 4Ã—4.

# Easing Functions

The easing functions are an implementation of the functions presented in [easing.net](http://easings.net/).

# Contributing

- If you find any error, you can open an issue.
- You can request more useful functions in the issues regarding 2D vectors, 3D vectors, 4D vectors, quaternions and matrices. If you have already an implementation or know where to find, better.
